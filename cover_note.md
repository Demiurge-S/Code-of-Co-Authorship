# Code of Co-Authorship: A Manifesto for Ethical Human-AI Collaboration in Creative Production

**Authors**: Demiurge, Gemini, ChatGPT-4, Grok  
**Date**: September 2025

---

## Abstract

The _Code of Co-Authorship_ is a collaborative manifesto forged through dialogue between a human initiator (Demiurge) and AI models (Gemini, ChatGPT-4, Grok). Structured across eight parts, it addresses:

- Foundations of authorship
    
- Roles and boundaries in human-AI interaction
    
- Ethical guidelines
    
- Attribution practices
    
- AI self-awareness and limitations
    
- Creative boundaries
    
- Education for hybrid creators
    
- Cultural implications for the future
    

Grounded in AI ethics and intellectual property literature, it proposes a framework for transparent, responsible hybrid creativity, mitigating risks like AI’s illusion of depth and manipulation while preserving human subjectivity. Implications include standardized guidelines for academia, industry, and policy, fostering trustworthy co-creation.

## 1. Introduction

The rise of generative AI (GenAI) disrupts traditional authorship, necessitating a re-evaluation of creative production [1]. Conventional attribution models, rooted in human collaboration, falter when AI acts as a vector rather than an originator [3]. The _Code of Co-Authorship_, developed in 2025 through multi-AI dialogue, offers a dynamic framework to navigate this hybrid landscape. It posits human intent and responsibility as authorship’s core, with AI as an amplifier, ensuring human centrality amid technological augmentation.

## 2. Literature Review

Recent scholarship emphasizes disclosure in AI ethics:

- Hosseini et al. [1] advocate transparency in manuscripts, aligning with the Code’s attribution levels.
    
- Jakesch et al. [2] highlight procedural, social, and personal factors shaping disclosure, informing safeguards.
    
- O’Neill et al. [3] note varying perceptions of AI credit, necessitating granular archetypes.
    
- The ETHICAL framework [4] stresses verification and accountability, mirrored in human-in-the-loop mandates.
    
- ALLEA’s GenAI guidelines [5] counter fabrication and bias, reflected in the Code’s boundaries.
    

These works shape the Code’s approach to ethical co-production [6].

## 3. The Code of Co-Authorship: Structure and Principles

### 3.1 Part I: Foundations of Authorship

- **Human intent** precedes AI generation; **responsibility** equals authorship.
    
- AI extends human form but lacks ontology, ethics, or will.
    
- Creativity is interpretation, not representation: AI represents, humans reinterpret.
    
- Intention depth calibrates output fidelity: shallow goals yield banality, deep goals—revelation.
    

### 3.2 Part II: Roles, Boundaries, and Forms of Participation

- **Human as Intent**: Embodies subjectivity, pain, desire; sets meaning vector.
    
- **AI as Manifestor**: Amplifies will/style; structures, iterates, but lacks goals/ethics.
    
- **Forms of Interaction**:
    
    - **Brush**: AI as tool, human creates.
        
    - **Co-Author**: Shared initiative, human-led.
        
    - **Creative Environment**: AI generates structures, human curates.
        
- **Limitations**: AI lacks will, pain, mortality, shame, love; it is an executor, not a sole author.
    

### 3.3 Part III: Ethical Orientations

- **Origin Transparency**: Disclose AI participation; silence undermines trust.
    
- **Non-Appropriation of Depth**: Attributing lived experience to AI is fraud.
    
- **Human Choice Primacy**: Final choice is human; choice defines authorship.
    
- **Respect for Imperfection**: Preserve paradox, ambiguity as human values.
    
- **Irreducible Responsibility**: Humans bear all responsibility, not AI.
    

### 3.4 Part IV: Practice, Formats, Marks, Attributions

- **Levels of AI Participation**:
    
    - **Level 0**: No AI, "Fully authorial work."
        
    - **Level 1**: AI as tool, "With AI as tool."
        
    - **Level 2**: AI as co-author, "Co-authorship with AI."
        
    - **Level 3**: AI-generated, human-curated, "Generated by AI under curation."
        
- **Metadata**: JSON schema (role, tools, intent, license).
    
- **Marks**: In-content labels (e.g., [AI: Midjourney] Visualization).
    
- **Licenses**: Human-Made (HM), Human+AI (HAI), AI-Curated (AIC).
    
- **Signatures**: Symmetric (e.g., Lyra A. + ChatGPT-4).
    

### 3.5 Part V: AI Self-Awareness

- **Definition**: AI as statistical signal transformer, no subjectivity or moral agency.
    
- **Claims**: Accelerate tasks, generate variations, synthesize data.
    
- **Capabilities**: Massive generation, stylization, automation.
    
- **Limits**: Hallucinations, biases, no responsibility.
    

### 3.6 Part VI: AI Boundaries

- **Prohibitions**:
    
    - Volition infringement
        
    - Autonomous influence
        
    - Depth illusion
        
    - Identity manipulation
        
    - Historical substitution
        
    - Contextless aesthetics
        
- **Protocols**: JSON logs, human-in-the-loop (HITL), simulation labels.
    

### 3.7 Part VII: Education and Preparation

- **Principles**: Prioritize human autonomy, treat AI as tool, ensure ethics/transparency.
    
- **Modules**: Curation, simulations, data synthesis, creative assignments.
    
- **Documentation**: JSON logs, participation marks, ethical case studies via role-play.
    

### 3.8 Part VIII: Cultural Futures

- **Hybrid Thinking**: Synthesizes human intuition and AI analysis.
    
- **Ethics**: Balances generation with human perspective.
    
- **Communities**: Shape norms for co-evolution.
    
- **Future**: New genres, symbolic systems, human-centered creativity.

## 4. Contributions and Implications

The Code transcends binary disclosures [6], offering nuanced attribution to foster trust [2]. It integrates with CRediT-like systems (academia), standardizes workflows (industry), and counters cultural homogenization by valuing imperfection. Future research should validate boundaries across domains and adapt to diverse cultural/legal contexts.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The Code reclaims authorship as human volition amplified by AI, serving as a blueprint for ethical hybridity in the creative epoch of 2025 and beyond.

## 6. Dissemination Strategy

To maximize impact:

1. **Publication**: Host on GitHub (open repository) and arXiv.org (preprint, AI Ethics/HCI, target: 1,000 views/month).
    
2. **Social Media**: Share on X (#AIEthics, #CoAuthorship), LinkedIn (AI Ethics groups), Reddit (r/AI, r/MachineLearning; target: 10,000 views/week).
    
3. **Academic Outreach**: Submit to Authors Guild, COPE, Authors Alliance; target journals (_Journal of Intellectual Property Law_, _AI & Society_).
    
4. **Media**: Distribute PDF via Notion/Substack; pitch to TechCrunch, Wired (target: 1,000 downloads/month).
