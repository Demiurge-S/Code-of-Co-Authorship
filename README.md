## Essence

A living manifesto born from the dialogue of **human-AI collaboration**, this project explores **hybrid creativity** and the **ontology of meaning** in the era of **hybrid thinking**. It defines a new culture of **co-authorship**, where **human-centered AI**, **ethical AI**, and **creative responsibility** shape the process of meaning formation.

The **Code of Co-Authorship** establishes:
- **Foundations of Authorship**: Intent, responsibility, and human will as the core of creativity.
- **Roles and Boundaries**: Archetypes of interactionâ€”human as intent, AI as manifestor.
- **Ethical Orientations**: Principles like transparency, non-appropriation of depth, and respect for human imperfection.
- **Practical Frameworks**: Standards for attributing AI participation and fostering **creative process** integrity.
- **Future of Culture**: A vision for **cultural evolution** through **hybrid thinking** and **ethical AI**.

*"Your intent is the spark; AI is the flame. Together, they illuminate meaning."*

## Goals

To create a clear, ethical, and inspiring framework for **human-AI collaboration**, fostering **co-creation** that preserves human authenticity while leveraging AI as a tool for **creative expression** and **meaning formation**.
