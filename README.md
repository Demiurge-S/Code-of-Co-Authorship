## üåç Quick Announcement

I'm thrilled to share the *Code of Co-Authorship*, a pioneering framework crafted in dialogue with AI models to redefine creativity in the AI era. This living manifesto addresses authorship, ethics, and cultural futures, ensuring human intent remains at the heart of hybrid creation.  

Key highlights:  
‚úÖ Defines authorship as human will and responsibility, with AI as an amplifier.  
‚úÖ Proposes transparent attribution (levels 0‚Äì3, JSON logs) to build trust.  
‚úÖ Sets boundaries to prevent AI manipulation or historical distortion.  
‚úÖ Envisions hybrid thinking as a new cultural paradigm.  

The Code is a call to creators, researchers, and policymakers to shape ethical co-creation. Read the full text: [codex.md](codex.md) | [PDF](codex.pdf) | [arXiv Preprint (forthcoming)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.xxxx)  

How can we ensure AI enhances, not overshadows, human creativity? Join the conversation!
